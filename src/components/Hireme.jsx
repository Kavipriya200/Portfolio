            Front-End Development Internship

            During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on various
            front-end development projects that helped me enhance my skills in
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I collaborated with a talented team of
            developers and gained valuable insights into real-world coding
            practices. I worked on building responsive websites, optimizing
            performance, and improving user experience.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify max-w-lg text-lg mt-4 text-gray-100 leading-7 mx-auto">
            One of the key highlights of my internship was contributing to a
            live project where I played a significant role in developing the
            front-end architecture.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify max-w-lg text-lg mt-4 text-gray-100 leading-7 mx-auto">
            This internship not only honed my technical skills but also taught
            me the importance of teamwork, communication, and adapting to new
            technologies. I’m excited to apply the lessons I’ve learned in
            future projects and continue growing as a developer.
